Layer architecture for the facial expression model.

- Input imgae is a grayscale and of size 48*48 so the shape would be (1,48*48)

- The first conv layer is of (inp=1, out=512)
    The image tensor would be (48 - 3 + 2*0)/2 + 1 = 23
    where 3 is kernel size, 0 is padding and bottom 2 is stride. Final tensor would be of size
    512*23*23

- The second conv layer is (inp=512, out=256)
    The image tensor would be (23 - 3 + 2*0)/2 + 1 = 11
    where 3 is kernel size, 0 is padding and bottom 2 is stride. Final tensor would be of size
    256*11*11

- The thirs conv layer is (inp=256, out=128)
    The image tensor would be (11 - 3 + 2*0)/2 + 1 = 5
    where 3 is kernel size, 0 is padding and bottom 2 is stride. Final tensor would be of size
    128*5*5

- We apply max pool after this. So, it will become - 128*2*2

This will be the input dimensions that we need to pass in for the linear layer.
